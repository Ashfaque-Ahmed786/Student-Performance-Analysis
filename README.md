# Student-Performance-Analysis
# 🎯 Student Performance Analysis (EDA Project)

This project explores a real-world dataset of over **30,000 student records** using Python and key data science libraries. The objective is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and uncover insights into what factors influence academic performance.

## 📁 Dataset

- 📊 File: `Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv`
- 📌 Contains: Demographic info, parental education, test preparation, scores in Math, Reading, Writing
- 🔗 [Link to source if public] *(optional)*

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory analysis
- Visualize trends based on gender, ethnic group, and parental education
- Detect correlations between subject scores
- Generate insights for potential educational strategies

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Gender distribution plots  
- Parental education vs average scores (bar chart + heatmap)  
- Subject-wise score distribution (boxplots)  
- Ethnic group analysis (pie chart + countplot)  
- Correlation matrix of subjects

## 💡 Insights

- Students with higher parental education perform better  
- Strong correlation between Reading and Writing scores  
- Certain ethnic groups and genders show performance gaps  
- Test preparation and study hours matter

## 🚀 Future Work

- Build a machine learning model to predict student scores  
- Deploy visualizations as an interactive Streamlit dashboard  
- Integrate more datasets (attendance, socio-economic data)

## 📷 Sample Output

*Add screenshots of your visualizations in an `/images` folder and link here*

## 📂 How to Use
